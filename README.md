Amazon Sales Database Analysis Project

Overview
This project is a structured database analysis based on an Amazon-like e-commerce system. The objective is to design a normalized relational database, write optimized SQL queries, and extract meaningful business insights related to customers, orders, products, inventory, payments, and shipping operations.

Business Objective
E-commerce platforms handle large volumes of transactional data. This project focuses on solving real-world business problems such as order tracking, revenue analysis, inventory monitoring, customer behavior analysis, and payment status tracking using SQL-based data analysis.

Database Design
A normalized relational database schema was designed using entity relationship modeling. The database includes the following core entities:
Customers
Orders
Order Items
Products
Categories
Brands
Inventory
Payments
Shipping

Primary and foreign key relationships are implemented to ensure data integrity and efficient querying.
